### Scotland Yard Project ###

Developed in NetBeans by Louis Heath and William Hawkins.

The task for this project was to produce a working model of the board game 'Scotland Yard', and optionally to produce AIs to play against.

'cw-model' is our implementation of the game Scotland Yard. It is a full working model. 'cw-ai' contains our AIs for both MrX and the Detectives.

Our AIs utilize Dijkstra's algorithm as well as minimax with alpha-beta pruning
